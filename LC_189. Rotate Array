#Problem - Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]

# Solution ------------>
#Intuition
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

#Approach
This approach is based on the fact that we rotate the array k times, k elements from the back end of the array come to the front and the rest of the elements from the front shift backwards.

In this approach, we firstly reverse all the elements of the array. Then, reversing the first k elements followed by reversing the rest n-k elements gives us the required result.

Example - Let n = 7 and k = 3;
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

Complexity
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
Code
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        k = k%nums.length;
        reverse(nums,0,nums.length-1);
        reverse(nums,0,k-1);
        reverse(nums,k,nums.length-1);
    }
    public void reverse(int nums[],int start, int end){
      while(start<end){
        int temp = nums[end];
        nums[end] = nums[start];
        nums[start] = temp;
        start++;
        end--;
      }
    }
}
