#Problem - 
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

#Solution

#Approach
Logic is to swap the first character from the last character.

#Complexity
Time complexity: O(n)

Space complexity: O(1)

Code
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
     
        for(int i=s.length-1;i>=s.length/2;i--){
          char t = s[i];
          s[i] = s[s.length-1-i];
          s[s.length-1-i] = t;
        }
        
    }
}
